# daily_scheduler

In this assignment we are tasked with creating a day scheduler using a mix of HTML and Jquery. It was certainly a challenge to figure out how to interweave all of the differing aspects that went into such a simple whole. When you open the page, underneath the header of the page you will find the current day, month, year, and the time you opened the page. Upon further examination you will find that the colors of each row correspond with what time of day it is, grey being the past, red being the present, and green being the future. On the left side of the table you will find time stamps for each hour of the working day. On the right, you will see the save buttons which will save whatever you add to the text area into the local storage and will hold it in the text area even when the page was refreshed.
